# Delta Time

__*Delta Time*__ is a lightweight, general-purpose Java framework used to develop GUI applications and games. It consists of a core library that can be extended with optional modules for particular development niches.

Delta Time includes utilities for:
* Text rendering
* Scripting
* UI elements
* Game development paradigms
* NPC AI
* Physics
* File I/O
* 2D sprite management
* Debugging
* Sound
* ... and much more!

### DeltaScript

Delta Time houses the main implementation of [DeltaScript](https://github.com/jbunke/deltascript) in its `script` module.

DeltaScript is skeletal scripting language that was initially designed to be extended into domain-specific languages for programs built with Delta Time that allowed for user scripting. It is now merely a language standard and is target language- and platform-agnostic. For more information about DeltaScript, please visit [its dedicated repository](https://github.com/jbunke/deltascript), which includes:
* syntax grammar
* language specification
* other documentation

### External dependency in my other programs

You may be interested in Delta Time for its use as an external dependency in my other source-available programs. You can download the JAR file needed to compile [Stipple Effect](https://github.com/jbunke/stipple-effect) and other programs [here](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time/releases).
